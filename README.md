# Python_Password_Checker
This is a python project which helps you identify if your password is secure or not.
There is a website called "Have i been pwned" which allows you to enter your password and checks for the occurrence of that password in the leaked passwords database to tell you if your password has been found or not.
However, giving away your passwords to a website is not always the most secure option. Hence, this code takes your password ; converts it to hash ; gives the HASHED password to the API of the website and requests for database containing the information on number of occurrences of your password.
This is a secure method for checking your passwords.
